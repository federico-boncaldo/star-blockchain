# Private Star Blockchain Application
This application represents the first project for the (Blockchain Developer Nanodegree)(https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309). It consists of a private blockchain that allows registering stars and checking the addresses related to every submission.
## How to run the application

Please run `node app.js` within the folder of the application.

## How to use the application

You can access all the endpoints available at the URL: `http://localhost:8000/` using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or any API Client.
The application has six endpoints:

1. `/block/height/:height` it's a `GET` request that allows the user to retrieve a block by the height specified by the last parameter;
2. `/requestValidation` it's a `POST` request that allows the user to request message ownership (necessary to submit a star). A JSON object needs to be specified in the request's body with this format with a Bitcoin address defined into it. ``` {
    "address": address_string
} ```;
3. `/submitstar` it's a `POST` request that allows the user to submit a new star by specifying an address, signature, and star object inside a JSON object. The `/requestValidation` request returns the message string; the signature is generated by signing a message with a Bitcoin wallet and address used in the previous request: ```{
    "address": address_string,
    "signature":signature_string,
    "message":message_string,
    "star": {
        "dec":"+01Â° 53' 52.0\"",
        "ra":"12h 09m 41.30s",
        "story":"Testing the story 1"
    }
}```;
4. `/block/hash/:hash` it's a `GET` request that allows the user to retrieve a block by the hash specified by the last parameter;
5. `/blocks/:address` it's a `GET` request that allows retrieving all the blocks in the chain related to a specific address;
6. `/validate-chain` it's a `GET` request that allows checking the validity of the entire chain;
